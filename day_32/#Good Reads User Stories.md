#Good Reads User Stories

###Abby
After signing up, would like 'skip' button more prominent and clear.
Landing page, message at top too small, thought it was an ad. Drawn to images first over text. Unsure what to do next. Suggested a walk thru guidelines. Liked listopia feature. Would like recommendations on landing page.
Overall site, type too small didn't want to read it. Would like to see friends listed who share similar interests in books. Confused by search function. 
Wording in green button not clearly understood "read", to read or has read.
Confused by friends and follow, unsure how to follow others. Thought info on right side of landing page was ad stuff. Too much going on. Thought quote of the day, challenges, amazon link and poll weren't necessary. Thought recommendations, bookshelves and currently reading important. Would like some guidance on updates. Too many options on left side in "my books," too much text. Wants to see better organization of tools. Thought Links looked like text and not sure that it was a button because of small size, not prominent. 
Didn't like the hover box over books, would have liked to have been able to see hover boxes of books side by side to compare. Liked book covers.
Would like option to buy books on spot. Unsure about company's goal.
New features she would like to see:
    1. Recommendations from friends and goodreads based on interests on landing page.
    2. easy to find want to read list
    3. easy option to give suggestions to friends

###Me
Site not intuitive. Not very friendly for new users, have to figure
it out yourself. Stuff seems to be nestled in menus, hard to navigate.
Too much going on in the Main section and the aside.
Header banner looks dated. Colors are dull, not very exciting.
Updates needs more line height. Are quotes and comments necessary elements?
No real heirarchy for information.

###Sam
Site not intuitive, cluttered too much info on my books page.
Would like to see larger book covers.

###Francois
Home page not intuitive.
Didn't find a fluid experience, not very welcoming.
Nothing grabbed me color wise, drab colors.
Stars make it seem like book version of amazon.

###Andrea
Too many elements. 

###Tito
Feature heavy, too many features. Info super cramped.
No feedback from the site, not very friendly. No direction, not focused
not sure where to start on page. 

###Jesse
So my biggest beef with Goodreads is that it's inconsistent between the app and the website. The app is really well done and intuitive and easy to use, and the website isn't. For the landing page, I like the social feed of it, that's how I find a lot of books that I want to read. Something about it feels very stale, though. It's not like Twitter or Instagram where I want to keep scrolling. I don't know if it's the colors or the typeface or what, but it feels old. I like the reading challenge, and wish there were a way to incorporate that with friends, kind of like how you can do challenges on fitbit. For the my books page, the first thing I notice is that the books header that's on the landing page is missing. I wish the books page were more organized, right now it feels like an excel table-which that sounds contradictory, but right now I don't understand the method to their madness or if everything they include is needed. It also feels _very_ cramped to me.  For the  profile page, it also feels very cramped and I don't know if everything that they have is necessary. Overall, I think the whole site could be simplified and more clean. It's cramped and stuffy and dirty feeling to me.

###Dawn
The design/look feels outdated. I associate books and ready with a cozy, warm feeling and that’s not happening with this app. There are a lot of features, and it feels very much like Amazon. I’d prefer a simple, straight-forward way to manage my own content. The personal profile page doesn’t seem to have much use to me actually. I think the photos of the books are way too small. I think a great way to cute some of the business would be to see more book and less text. Do you know what I mean? People are very visual, they’ll recognize a book cover/be drawn to it before reading the specs on it. The main page/feed is pretty basic, but I think it could be compartmentalized a little instead of random “recents” from followers. And on the “my books” page, I like that you can organize by type (currently reading etc.) but I’d still like it to be less of a big list. That left side content does not have an hierarchy over the rest of the text on the page, but it actually the part of the page I want to utilize the most.

###Becky
Why do you use this site?  

I would use primarily to remember books I would like to read in the future. it's also nice to get recommendations based on both the books I've read as well as the books I'd like to read.

Do you use it socially?

   I might for book club. 

Do you use good reads for discovering new reads?
  
  Yes I will. Actually wasted too much time at work today rating books and looking at my recommendations. 

What features do you like about the site?

   Rating books I've read.  I also like that you can keep track of the date that you read the book.

What features do you dislike?

   I thought that the concept of the book shelf was nice but a little convoluted. I also think that the books that I've  identified as "want to reads" should feature more prominently. I care way more about that than what's been recommended for me.  

What features would you like to see?

   I don't remember seeing reviews...

Any other thoughts?

   Compatible with Amazon/Kindle, but I generally buy my ebooks from iBooks, so it wouldn't be so seamless to buy books via this site.


###Julianna
Why do you use this site? 
I have not used it in a long time. I think I initially used it to find something good to read based on what my friend had read. 

Do you use it socially?

Not anymore, but when I did use it, yes. 
Do you use good reads for discovering new reads?

I did. 
What features do you like about the site?

You can see what books your friends have read. I think I registered with Facebook, which made it easy to sign up, easy to log back in and connect with friends. I was able
to successfully find out what my friends had read. I'm not sure I ever obtained any new books based on this. It's doubtful that I ever  actually read anything new via this site. This was probably many years ago. 
What features do you dislike?

I don't recall any particular frustrations, but it's been a while. 
What features would you like to see?

At the time, I was mostly listening to books on tape via Audible or reading books on my Kindle. I think there was some sort of integration there with Kindle, perhaps. Anything that makes it easier for me to go from "I should read that" to actually reading would be handy.
Any other thoughts?

I tend to fall out of the habit of reading and I find it hard to get back in the habit. I wouldn't mind if the app, or my friends who use the app, sent me messages to get me re-engaged.

###Jenn
Joined because another reader recommended it. Liked all the reviews. Thinks highly of staff picks over customer reviews. Finds some reviews too corporate and generic, wants more raw emotions. Wants more social media, maybe connect with instagram so users can upload book pics. Unsure of how good reads recommends books to her because their picks seem too general, it feels too barnes and noble like, would like more conversation. Likes the star ratings, but would like to see images of books next to ratings and user images to feel more connected. Wants to see an option for friends to suggest books. Didn't like getting all the emails from good reads, seemed like spam and were too generic so she stopped paying attention to them. Stopped using good reads because there was no incentive and friends weren't talking about it. Started going to the library and asking librarian for recommendations. Good reads encouraged her to read more. she would like to see the site sectioned in a better way, similar to Netflix. 

###Charlie
Immediately attracted by the book covers. Liked the genre features and reviews, spent a lot of time reading reviews. Didn't seem to care about the social media part of the site or seeing updates from friends. Also didn't care too much for the profile page. Enjoyed the explore feature. Uses another site cheap reads for finding books. Likes not being sold anything, but appreciates the option to buy on the good reads site.

###Rachel
I use this site for book club.  In fact, I only signed up for this site right after it was maybe my turn to choose and I wanted to come up with a good book. 

Do you use it socially?
Since it's new for me, I haven't used it socially at all.  I really just use it for recommendations and reviews.  Connecting with others digitally is not something that I feel comfortable with...not for folks I've never met.

Do you use good reads for discovering new reads?
Absolutely.  I love using it for discovering new books I should check out.  There are so many books but few that really captivate; I love that Goodreads cut through some of the less pleasing reads.

What features do you like about the site?
Again, I like the recommendations and suggestions (ie. the subject genres).  I love reading some book and then finding more suggestions like that book...like Netflix.

What features do you dislike?
Hmmm....maybe...right now, embarrassingly, I'm into teeny-bopper novels and I would love to find more of the same.  Where are they?  Wish they were easier to find.

Other things I'd like to see...Really, I haven't looked at Goodreads and possibly it already exists however, are there questions for reading novels?  Questions for book clubs?  I'd be interested in that aspect.
