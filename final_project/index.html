					<h3>Mission</h3>
					<p>Mentorship offers an array of amazing benefits. A good mentor is wise and willing to share his or her knowledge and experiences in order to help you succeed. It’s like having a North Star to guide you whenever you’re feeling unsure or in need of support. Mentors can help you set and achieve career goals, make smart business decisions, overcome workplace challenges, learn new skills or offer an outside perspective when you’re facing frustrations at work.The sky is the limit with all the benefits mentorship can offer.</p>


<p>Mentors are helpful regardless of where you are in your career. Whether you’re fresh out of college, a coding school, looking to make a career change or a few years from retirement, there are always others who have “been there, done that” from whom you can learn and look up to.</p>

<p>Having a mentor can elevate your professional capabilities exponentially.
When you take the time to develop a strong mentorship relationship, you get access to a wealth of knowledge and experience, but you also end up with a lifelong friend and potential future business partner.</p>

<p>It is very challenging to seek out someone as a design/developer mentor. 
The choice of person makes a big difference in the success of the relationship and, ultimately, in YOUR success.</p>  

<p>Austin, Texas has a great Design and Development community that is open to sharing knowledge. Look Up provides a platform where Austin Design and Development professionals who are interested in being mentors and eager to share their industry knowledge and skills can be paired with students, young professionals and others who are seriously interested in learning.</p> 

<p>Mentees can pay it forward and become mentors, creating a cycle of knowledge sharing.</p>
			

			<h3>How it Works</h3>
			<p>Signing up is easy</p>
