Where I'm at
I decided to go with the mentorship app. I've done research, read alot of articles, looked at dating sites for ideas on how to go about pairing people. 
I did a word list to get ideas for possible tones for the site.

Challenges
Picking words to narrow down name possibilities. 

Moving forward
Once I have a few name possibilities then I can focus on tones and different directions for style tiles.
