# Stand up: 7-30-15

Where I'm at
Spent way too much time trying to figure out a name, still don't have one
needed to move on.
Grouped words from my word list to narrow down 5 themes/ideas to create style tiles.

Challenges
Accepting that it's ok to not have a name


Moving forward
Continue to brainstorm name ideas, but time myself. 
pick style tile direction
