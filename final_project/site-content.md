### Mission Statement

It is very challenging to seek out a stranger as a design/developer mentor. As someone looking for a mentor, I don't want to seem like a creep or bother anyone, I genuinely want some guidance about the field from a professional  who is willing to share it.  

Austin, Texas has a great Design and Development community that is open to sharing knowledge. I plan on creating a platform where Austin Design and Development professionals who are interested in being mentors and sharing their industry knowledge and skills can be paired with students, young professionals and others who are seriously interested in learning. Then the mentees can pay it forward and become mentors, creating a cycle of knowledge sharing.

Austin Designers/Developers who care about helping others interested in their field and are willing to take the time to share their knowledge.  

Students, young professionals, people interested in making a transition into the field or struggling in the field and looking for a mentor.
