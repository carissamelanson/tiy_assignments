### Mission Statement

Mentorship offers an array of amazing benefits. A good mentor is wise and willing to share his or her knowledge and experiences in order to help you succeed. It’s like having a North Star to guide you whenever you’re feeling unsure or in need of support. Mentors can help you set and achieve career goals, make smart business decisions, overcome workplace challenges, learn new skills or offer an outside perspective when you’re facing frustrations at work.The sky is the limit with all the benefits mentorship can offer.

Mentors are helpful regardless of where you are in your career. Whether you’re fresh out of college, a coding school, looking to make a career change or a few years from retirement, there are always others who have “been there, done that” from whom you can learn and look up to.

Having a mentor can elevate your professional capabilities exponentially.
When you take the time to develop a strong mentorship relationship, you get access to a wealth of knowledge and experience, but you also end up with a lifelong friend and potential future business partner.

It is very challenging to seek out someone as a design/developer mentor. 
The choice of person makes a big difference in the success of the relationship and, ultimately, in YOUR success.

### guidelines
1. Care about your mission, goals and integrity. Care about other people. Care about your mentor or mentee’s time, and have a purpose for finding a mentor or mentee. Neither person will benefit unless you care.

2.Mentorship is a serious commitment of time and care. Be direct about what you want to learn. Identify your goals and articulate them to your mentor or mentee so you can work together to achieve them. Never mix mentoring with the desire for money, a job, a promotion, a reference or some other ulterior motive. If you want something else, ask for it directly.
