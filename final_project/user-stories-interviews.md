Mema82: I think there should be more mentorship opportunities for those who demonstrate passion in the field and dedication to succeed instead on selecting only the ones who already have talent in the specified areas..

@cory_foy: Yeah, I see a lot of mentors grabbing up those who already demonstrate talent or come from a “tech” background already just to get them to greater levels and have a hand in that when I feel that the greater reward would come from mentoring those who are not “naturals” but have their heart and soul in it…. and of course have the ability to be mentored (if that makes sense) . It’s great to help both types of people but usually it’s the underdog who goes un-noticed.

@mema82: Thanks for the clarification! As someone who has run two separate apprenticeship programs in the past, and is working here at TIY with our corporate clients, it’s great to have insight into topics like that.

Glad to hear @cory_foy ! I hope that this will be taken to heart to help any current or future students at TIY :thumbsup:

@mema82: I think you should also consider what the mentor has to do and how well they are able to teach.  

For example if the mentor isn’t a great teacher then working with someone who already has a tech background or ‘natural’ talent makes it much easier for them to explain or demonstrate things.

mema82 [2:25 PM] 
Very true @alexplate , but isn’t the whole point of mentorship, and in particular TIY,  to take someone with no tech background and help them be as successful as they want? If mentors only take the “front-runners” and give them extra help/opportunities then the ones who need that extra help go unattended.

mema82 [2:26 PM]
or I should say the whole point of mentorship “should be” (the above) :simple_smile:

Hmm

ruthan [2:28 PM]
I think of mentorship as more of a higher-level metaplanning kind of relationship

ruthan [2:29 PM]
If you're a very beginning developer, your mentor says "try these tutorials" and helps you figure out whether you'd be happier as a web dev or a sysadmin

ruthan [2:30 PM]
And maybe helps you if you get really hung up on a concept

mema82 [2:32 PM] 
Interesting @ruthan :simple_smile: I think of “try these tutorials” as more of an online bootcamp thing, not a person to person thing.

ruthan [2:32 PM] 
But there are bajillions of them, and some of them suck

mema82 [2:33 PM] 
mentors or tutorials? :wink: lol

ruthan [2:33 PM] 
Ha, tutorials :simple_smile:

alexpate [2:33 PM] 
@ruthan: I agree.  Mentorship should be more about exposing you to concepts and resources you may not be aware of.  And offering clarification when you are unsure.
