###Blue Dahlia Bistro Redesign

Goodreads started in 2007 and is the world's largest site for readers and book recommendations. The company's mission is to help people find and share books they love.  Goodreads values fun, creativity and knowledge. The husband and wife co-founders wanted to build a website where the user could see their friends' bookshelves and learn about what they thought of all their books. They wanted to create a site experience where users can explore new books, gather information and expand their minds. 

The current Goodreads website doesn't reflect their fun and creative values. The site is cluttered with information, difficult to navigate and not very intuitive. Based on user interviews, user base falls off. After looking at competitor sites, the site doesn't look current and there isn't anything that makes Goodreads preferable over another site.

### Goals
Goals of this project are to find out what the main function of the site is and make it more accessible to the user. Make a site with features that are important to the user. Add an element of delight for the user that reinforces Goodreads' company values and keeps the user returning to the site.

### Solution
Solutions to achieve the project goals are: simplify the layout, so that content can breathe and key features are easy to find, bring in more heirarchy so the user can figure out the actions of the app, create a tone for the site that brings in an element of delight.
