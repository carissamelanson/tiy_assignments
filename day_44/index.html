				<h2>Project Overview</h2>
				<h3>Company History</h3>
				<p>Blue Dahlia opened it's first location on East 11th street in 2007. A second location was opened in Westlake in 2012. What started off as a partnership between one of the owners and an investor blossomed into a romance and they married.</p>
				<h3>Simple, Fresh and Sincere</h3>
				<p>Blue Dahlia is a European bistro that serves simple, healthy food. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner from a menu featuring breads, salads, tartines and cheeses. The owners are committed to using local, organic, and sustainable  ingredients from local vendors and farms.</p>
				<h3>Awards</h3>
				<p>Blue Dahlia has a casual and cool atmosphere that makes it a great spot for date nights. The Best of Austin Awards awarded Blue Dahlia the "Best Cheap Date" award two years in a row and "Best Place to Take a First Date".</p>
				<h3>Challenges</h3>
				<p>Their current website is not responsive, lacks images of their food and lacks hierarchy that would create more ease for the user to read menus. The navigation is inconsistent, making it difficult to navigate. After doing competitor research, the site and brand look outdated and do not represent the casual and cool atmosphere of Blue Dahlia. Hundreds of people are moving to Austin daily and new restaurants are opening, Blue Dahlia needs a contemporary and unique site that stands out from its competitors.</p>
				<h3>Goals</h3>
				<p>My goal for this site redesign is to make it more accessible by making it responsive, with a navigation that is easy to navigate. I also want to bring in an element of delight to give the site a more cool and casual feel that reflects the atmosphere.</p>
				<h3>Solution</h3>
				<p>My solutions for the redesign:</p>
				<nav class="solution-list">
					<ul>
						<li>Bring in more images of food on the landing and menu pages.</li>
						<li>Add color and elements to give sense of delight.</li>
						<li>Create a simple and responsive layout.</li>
						<li>Add hierarchy to menus.</li>
					</ul>
				</nav>
				<h3>Phase 2</h3>
				<p>Develop a logo that reflects core values: Simple, Fresh and Sincere. Bring in elements of logo throughout the site.</p>
