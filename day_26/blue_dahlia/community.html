		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<div class="line-separator"></div>
		<p>Although our primary goal is the financial well-being of the business, it is imperative to us to be conscious of these important other objectives:
		Using organic and local products whenever available and being conscious of the effect of our products on the health and well-being of our customers and our staff.
		Optimizing the impact that our business practices and choices will have on the environment and our local community. Click here to read about our green initiatives including our composting with Compost Peddallers.
		Maintaining a high quality of attitude, fairness, understanding and generosity with our staff, our customers, our vendors and the local community.
		Providing the best service we can! We work as a team and while you have a main server you will be tended to by our entire Blue Dahlia staff.
		Awareness and implementation of these objectives will give our efforts a sense of purpose and meaning beyond our basic financial goals.</p>

		<h2>We love our local products!</h2>
		<div class="line-separator"></div>
		<p>We use as many local companies and farms as we can. Buying local helps in so many ways: keeping money in our community, creating new jobs, using less energy and emissions, keeping pay fair for farmers, and you get the freshest product! We use Farm to Table, a great company that bridges the gap between local farms and restaurants, as well as these other companies we adore:</p>
