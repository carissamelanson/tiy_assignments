				<h2>Project Overview</h2>
				<div class="group">
					<p>Look Up is a mentorship app that pairs Austin based designers and developers with mentors and mentees.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="group">
					<h3>Mission</h3>
					<p>Mentorship offers an array of amazing benefits. A good mentor is wise and willing to share his or her knowledge and experiences in order to help you succeed. It’s like having a North Star to guide you whenever you’re feeling unsure or in need of support. Mentors can help you set and achieve career goals, make smart business decisions, overcome workplace challenges, learn new skills or offer an outside perspective when you’re facing frustrations at work. The sky is the limit with all the benefits mentorship can offer.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="group">
					<h3>Austin, Texas</h3>
					<p>Austin, Texas has a great Design and Development community that is open to sharing knowledge. Look Up provides a platform where Austin Design and Development professionals who are interested in being mentors and eager to share their industry knowledge and skills can be paired with students, young professionals and others who are seriously interested in learning.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="group">
					<h3>Challenges</h3>
					<p>A challenge that I face is how to curate pairings of mentors and mentees so that useful and helpful pairings are made and how to keep the app useful and helpful for users so that user base doesn't fall.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="group">
					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<p>My goal for Look Up is to create a better Design/Developer community by helping others and developing mentees into mentors, continuing the knowledge sharing. I also want to create a platform where industry leaders have the opportunity to become mentors. Bringing an element of delight to site, encouraging users to mentor is also an important goal that I have for the app.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="group">
					<h3>Solution</h3>
					<p>My solutions:</p>
					<nav class="solution-list">
						<ul>
							<li>Conduct user interviews and surveys to find out what mentees and mentors are looking for.</li>
							<li>Make the site easy to use with simple input forms.</li>
							<li>Add color and elements to give sense of delight.</li>
							<li>Create a simple and responsive layout.</li>
						</ul>
