Good morning everyone.

Thank you for being here.

My name is Carissa.

### Background
Prior to the iron yard, I was a print designer interested in transitioning into web, but i didn't know where to start. It would have been a great time to have a mentor.

I'm sure you all can relate.

To simplify the process of finding a mentor, I created Look Up.

Look Up is an app that pairs Austin design and developer professionals with students, young professionals and people seriuosly interested in the industry.

### Process

To start my process, I researched the history of mentorship, researched dating and networking sites, watched the Seinfeld episode on mentors.

From there, I conducted users survey and used that data to create content for the site. 

After gathering research and data, I created style tiles to explore different concepts and themes. 

I chose to go with the North Star concept. The name Look Up comes from the concept of the North Star being a guide in the sky. Similar to mentors being guides for mentees.

Inspiration for the color scheme comes from star maps, but I used bold and bright colors to give the site a fun and inviting feel.

###Landing Page
To add to the fun and inviting feel I used CSS animation to create the twinkling star effect. I saw an example of this Star animation from a former design students codepen. I thought it fit with concept and wanted to experiment with new techniques.

Using CSS animations was challenging because it's not yet supported on all browsers, so testing was tricky. 

to keep in line with the theme i created icons that relfect the star concept.  I used large formats of the icons to break up the body copy and bring in interesting visual elements. As you'll see on the next page, I use the icons primarily as navigation.

### New User
Let's walk through the site as a new user.

### Onboarding
I used a bourbon refill jquery component for the question form.
Bourbon refills are code components that you can customize and put into the framework.


### Ending 
the hard part is finding a mentor or mentee,
now that is done for you and you can focus on developing a successful relationship!
