Good morning everyone.

Thank you for being here.

My name is Carissa.

Prior to the iron yard, I was a graphic designer interested in transitioning into web, but i didn't know where to start.

There are others in the similar situations.

To help people find guidance, I created Look Up.

A mentorship app that pairs Austin design and dev professionals with students, young professionals and people interested in the industry.
