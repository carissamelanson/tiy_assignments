## Week 1: Adventures in HTML and CSS

Week one was hard, but exciting. I definitely had a moment where I thought to myself, "Did I make the right decision to leave my job and throw myself into the unchartered and intimidating territory of coding?"
I've been happy with my decision so far - I'm learning something new every day. Sometimes information doesn't make sense right away, but it still feels good to be learning. 

The first weekend project was really challenging and after 16 hours of sitting at my desk coding a mockup, my body started to feel like it was morphing into my chair and my eyes probably didn't blink enough, but my general mood was happy. 

## Week 2: Dreams in Divs

During the Friday huddle, I was chosen to talk about what my class was learning. I hate feeling unprepared and I could feel anxiety forming in my chest, but I presented. And it was fine. Note to self: practice public speaking. It was also my birthday and the entire room sang, "Happy Birthday" to me. I definitely felt a sense of community. 

Writing html and css is starting to make some sense. I'm starting to get used to the terminology. Divs have been creeping into my subcoscious. One night I closed a div after a dream and opened a div for another dream. So weird.
