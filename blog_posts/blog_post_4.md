##Sass

I'm in week four at the Iron Yard and my brain hasn't worked this hard in 
a long time. I'm getting used to the slightly soft feeling in my head, maybe it's fatigue but I like to think of my brain as a sponge soaking up every bit 
of information that comes my way. And there has been a ton of new information, 
some of it makes sense and some of it doesn't. 

I know that Sass can be a huge help in writing CSS, but I don't think I fully understand all the benefits. Maybe because CSS just started to make sense to me.
I know that this is against the DRY principle, but writing code the long way and repeating stuff seems more logical to me right now. I need more practice and I need to see more examples of clean HTML and CSS.
