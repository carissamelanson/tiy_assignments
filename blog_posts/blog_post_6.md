##Helvetica: My first Love

My love for the typeface started at a young age, I think I was in kindergarten. 
I liked seeing my name in Helvetica on forms and name tags and I repeatedly saw it through
out my school years. It became familiar. 

In college I studied design and finally learned about the typeface. I realized I was attracted to the simplicity of it and the way the bowl of the lower case 'a' and spine of the letter 's' are so nicely curved and smooth.
I also realized that it was overused and then I was introduced to Futura. 

I loved Futura for a long time. Again, I was attacted by the simplicity. 
I loved the geometrical shapes and designed my first letterhead with the typeface.
Time passed and I was introduced to new typefaces and forget about Futura for a while.

Currently, I like Gotham and Adobe Garamond.

Helvetica and Futura still hold a special place in my heart. It's like when you sometimes associate songs to certain moments in your life, I associate typefaces.
